# Phonebook 2020

## Hi 👋

<br/> This project made with React as a Front-End, and Node.js using Exepress.js framework as a Back-End, and the data is stored in MongoDB database.
<br/> This project was made during my studies in <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en">Full Stack Open 2020</a> course.
<br/> This MOOC was introduced by the University of Helsinki in Finland by lecturers in Computer Science Department, and it's free for anyone around the world to join this MOOC.

### How to use

<br/> You can freely use this app and make your own version of it.
<br/> But first you need to make a little modifications to this app so it can store your own numbers to your own database, I'm using <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a> for storing my data, I recommend to you using the same.
<br/> Also you have to create <i>.env</i> file in the root of the app to store your environment variables for safe keeping.

Once you done with your modifications to the app, you are free to deploy it to the internet, you can use <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for this or any other website you like.
